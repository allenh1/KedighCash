KedighCash
==========
This software was written for an old teacher of mine, Mr. Kedigh. 
The program imports a text file with a format he created and parses the file. 
The students who submitted the classroom cash are stored with their respective
account balances. The cash can be saved, and the user can "cash" their submitted money. 

Export Types: 
============
There are two types of export: tab delineated by serial number, and tab delineated by owner (has their name, class period and balance). 

Supported Operating Systems: 
============================
- Ubuntu Linux (any linux with a Qt compiler)
- Windows XP, Windows 7
